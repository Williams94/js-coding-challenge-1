##Setup
To get set up, pull down this repo and cd into the folder.
 - Make sure you have `npm`, `node` and all that good stuff already installed 
 - Run `npm install`
 - Tests can be found in `/test`, use these as your guide and starting point
 - Write your solutions within the corresponding files inside `/app`
 - Run `npm test` to run your tests.
 - Make them all green!

##Rules
 - Expected time to complete task: **3 hours**
 - You can't install any more packages/frameworks. Use what's there.
 - You can't change any files outside of `/app`. Don't remove any template code within any of the task files either.
 - Feel free to read StackOverflow/Google. We're not looking for a copy/paste though. Just demonstrate understanding.
